# Always Online on Teams: A Simple Script that Simulates Mouse Movement

This project provides a simple PowerShell script that keeps Microsoft Teams status always online by simulating small mouse movements. The script runs seamlessly on PowerShell without needing any administrative rights. It operates discreetly, leaving no traces in the PowerShell logs, making it invisible to the IT department.

## Working Principle
The PowerShell script performs minimal mouse movements at regular intervals, ensuring that your Microsoft Teams status remains active. These movements are small enough not to disrupt your workflow but sufficient to prevent Teams from marking you as "Away."

## Features
- **No Admin Rights Required**: The script runs without elevated privileges.
- **Invisible Operation**: It does not get logged in the PowerShell journal.
- **Lightweight and Seamless**: The script is straightforward, with minimal resource usage.
- **Always Online**: Ensures that your Teams status remains active even when you're away from the computer.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Copy the Script**: Copy the provided PowerShell script.
2. **Run the Script**: Paste the script directly into your PowerShell terminal and execute it.
3. **Stay Online**: Once the script is running, your mouse will make small movements at regular intervals, keeping your Teams status always online.

No additional setup, installations, or administrative permissions are necessary.
